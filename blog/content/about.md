Written from my memories: Imagine, Thinking then code, I think this is what makes programming so amazing. Programming is imagine spending thousands and thousands of hours to learn how to code. but please learn how to think than how to code because technology must change in every second learn how to code is not good enough for every new requirement but learn how to think is better (included design), THINK FIRST CODE LATER.
